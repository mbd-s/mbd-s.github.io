          I&rsquo;m a Berlin-based software developer. I currently work as a
          <span class="tooltip"

              today</span

          >. Day-to-day, I work on cloud infrastructure and platform topics,
          using Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Go, Python, shell scripts, assorted
          cloud-provider technologies, and lots of other tools. Previously, I
          spent five years doing backend development, mostly with Ruby on Rails.
